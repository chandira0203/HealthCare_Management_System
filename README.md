I have developed a HealthCare Management System which can be tailored to a specific hospital to manage and handle the appoinments, patients and doctors records

The system is built with the use of html,css,javascript,php and MySql.
Since the system is based on php we need to make use server to host (eg.XAMPP)
download the entire folder -" HealthCare_Management_System" and save it in the htdocs folder (which will be present in xampp folder after you install XAMPP server)
.Open the xampp server and start the Apache and MySql module then browse localhost/phpmyadmin , create a database named "HealthcareDatabase" then import the data(i.e., Tables)  of "HealthCare_Mangement_Database" in the created database.
Host the website by entering localhost/HealthCare_Management_System in your browser (here HealthCare_Management_System is the folder name where all the source code is saved)

There is seperate login for patients,doctors and admins
. New patients can register via new-registration option and a seperate option is provided to book appoinments via Online

Once a patient gets registered the patient will be provided with the login Id and password
through which they can access the patients portal , change the password 
						       , see their history of appoinments 
						       , whether the apoinment is approved or not .In many of hospitals most of the patients face a problem called waiting time .Though their appoinments got approved for a particular slot but then also due to some emergency situations the doctor may not be available to consult on that particular time/slot/day and many patients will be informed about the schedule change only when they come to hospital ,that is where this healthcare managment system plays a major role to sort this 
issue.If at all a schedule should be changed or the appoinment are cancelled for that particular day then the patients with the help of this system can see whether the 
consulting time got changed or the appoinments got cancelled so that they can plan accordingly even before when they step out of the house.These changes can be updated by either doctors or admins.

Through doctors login panel the doctor can update his/her consulting timings ,view the appoinments
					  , Patients details.

The admin can change his/her password , 
		     view/add/delete patients records , 
                     view/approve/cancel/re-schedule the appoinments , 
		     view/add/delete doctors records , 
          	     view/add/delete other admins , 


To use this system make use of the following credintials

 	Login Id: admin
  
	Password: admin123

doctor

 	Login Id: doctor
  
	Password: doctor123

Patient
